## Dashboard Overview
The project overview will be shown and explained through Google Slides [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1137s3_O7ktF4cMPk-cHCNadZev04o0CW/edit#slide=id.p101)

Technical charts and graphs will be created and shared through Tableau. 

The first Tableau graph shows you how many people of each age have completed a survey, and you can filter for a specific age range. This graph is now grouped in bins of ten years.

The second graph shows number of participants by year. You can see a sensible drop off in the year 2020.

The third graph shows number of participants broken down by sex.

The fourth graph shows the visit outcome broken down by days of the week.
